        <h1><center> The Box Model </center></h1>
            <p> The box model is often what is referred to when in conversation about CSS layout and design. </p>
            <p> It consists of four parts; Margin, Border, Padding and Content </p>
        <h1><center> What are each of these elements exactly? </center></h1>
            <h3><center> Margin: </center></h3>
                <p> The margin is a clear area outside of the border element, this usually helps with website readability and just provides an overall cleaner look. </p>
            <h3> Border: </h3>
                <p> The border surrounds the padding and content. </p>
            <h3> Padding: </h3>
                <p> The padding is a clear area around the content which is transparent, this also helps with overall readability and provides a clean look. </p>
            <h3> Content: </h3>
                <p> The content is basically what it says on the tin, it's the images, text and video embeds etc which is usually the main reason for the website's existence. </p>

            <h1><center> Where Did The Term "Box Model" Come From? </center></h1>
            <p><center> Well, it seems fairly obvious why it is named as such, but who actually coined the term? I don't know, presumably some nerd somewhere not near any women... </center></p>
