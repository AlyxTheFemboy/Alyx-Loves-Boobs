            <h3><center> Margin: </center></h3>
                <p><center> The margin is a clear area outside of the border element, this usually helps with website readability and just provides an overall cleaner look. </center></p>

                <p><center> The border surrounds the padding and content. </center></p>
            <h3><center> Padding: </center></h3>
