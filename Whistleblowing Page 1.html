		<h1> Whistleblowing </h1>
		<p> Whistleblowing is the practice of reporting a witnessed or personally experienced case of malpractice in the workplace, usually with the intent of having the ne'erdowell punished for their actions. </p>
		<p> It is commonly often also referenced to as "making a disclosure" or "blowing the whistle" (the second one being a bit more on the obvious side though). </p>
